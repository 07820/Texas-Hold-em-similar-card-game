# Texas-Hold-em-similar-card-game
This game is a five-card battle game based on classic poker rules, where the player's goal is to defeat the computer opponent by forming the best possible combination of 5 cards (i.e., a hand). The game uses a standard 52-card deck (excluding Jokers).


# Game Objective:
The player needs to compare their hand with the computer's hand to win the round.

# Card Values and Suits:
Each card has a value between 1 and 14, and the suits include Hearts (♥), Diamonds (♦), Spades (♠), and Clubs (♣).
The Ace (A) can be used as either 1 or 14, depending on the need in a straight combination.
Hand Rankings (from highest to lowest):
Royal Flush: A, K, Q, J, 10 of the same suit.
Straight Flush: Five consecutive cards of the same suit.
Four-of-a-Kind: Four cards of the same rank.
Full House: Three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank.
Flush: Five cards of the same suit.
Straight: Five consecutive cards, not necessarily of the same suit.
Three-of-a-Kind: Three cards of the same rank.
Two Pair: Two pairs of different ranks.
One Pair: Two cards of the same rank.
High Card: If no other combinations are made, the highest card is compared.
# Basic Gameplay:
Click the "Start" (or "Deal") button in the game window to begin the game. The system will deal 5 cards to both the player and the computer.
The deck is shuffled at the start of each game to ensure randomness.
The game automatically calculates and displays the combination and ranking of the player's and the computer's hands.
At the end of each round, the winner is determined based on the hands' rankings, and the score is updated.
After the game ends, the final result is displayed, and the player can choose to start a new game.
# Swap cards:
In the first four rounds, the player can choose to swap up to three cards to improve their hand. Swapping is not allowed in the fifth round because only two cards will be left in the deck.
If the player chooses to swap cards, the computer will also decide whether to swap cards based on its hand.
This game is structured using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) methods to ensure code maintainability and extensibility. Players can enjoy the classic poker game through a simple and intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI).
